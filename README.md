## Usage
### Edit
Touch the current currency value field to edit the value. The display
will be updated dynamically as you type. Touch the **Done** button on
the numeric keypad to update the value field.  The whole value field
is selected by default when touched so it will be overwritten by
typing in a new value. To deselect the text, touch an adjacent area,
like the currency flag. This behaviour can be disabled in the settings
below.

### Toolbar

* **Add** a currency to the list. A scrollable list of currencies will
   pop up. Touch an entry to add it or touch the **Cancel** button
   below the list. Long touch an entry to select it. Once one currency
   is selected others may be added or removed from the selection by
   touching them. Another long touch on another currency will clear
   the list and select the new currency. Touch the **Clear** button to
   clear the selection. Touch the **Select** button to add the
   selection. The entries will be added to the list in the order
   selected.
* **Update** Get the day's currency rates from the
  [ECB](http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/exchange/eurofxref/html/index.en.html). The
  date shown on the left above the currency list will be updated if
  new rates are available. It may show the previous day because the
  rates are updated at around 14:15 CET. The status display on the
  right above the currency list will show 'OK', 'No Connection', 'No

to select it. Once one currency is selected others may be added or

  selected, the chart will be of the current currency and the selected
  currency. If more than one currency is selected the chart will be of

## Chart
The display shows an interactive chart of the last 90 days of
historical rates from the
[ECB](http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/exchange/eurofxref/html/index.en.html"). The
chart responds to two finger pinch and expand gestures and will scroll
once expanded. The toolbar icons from left to right are:
* **Invert** the chart.
* **New chart** The scrollable list of currencies will pop up. Select
  one or two currencies from the list as above to replace the current
  currencies in the chart.
* **Update** the chart.
* **Historical** The chart will be updated with nearly eighteen years
  of historical data currently dating from 1 April 1999. Not all the
